<h1> NPCs </h1>
<h2> What are NPCs, and how do they work? </h2>

<p>
NPCs are simply the AI characters (Those that are not controlled by the player) NPC stands for "Non Player Character. They have many options that can
be changed in the <b>Base</b>, these can be identified in the 
<a href="http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php/Category:NPC">GECK Wiki.</a> This will tell you the definitions, but 
what you also need to know for sure is the basics. For instance, despite what may be said, we are sad to inform
you that for any advanced dialoge options voice acting is required. This will be detailed in the page on dialoge.
</p>
<p>
There are two main types of NPCs; levelling dummies and unlevelled characters. Each work in different ways, but
unlevelled characters are the simplest and easiest to start off with, so here is where we will start the
tutorial. As shown in the above link, there are a number of tabs, such as Traits, Stats, AI data, AI packages,
Factions etc. You will come to know and love/hate all of them at one time or another.
So now you know what NPCs are, and how they work, we can get down to business.
</p>
<h2> Time to make some NPCs </h2>
<p>
So now you should have a good size building interior; cluttered and lit. So why not add some baddies to fight?
To start on creating an NPC the best idea is probably to grab one that you like the look of from the NPC menu 
(under "Actors", "NPC") and edit him/her. You may wish to create an entirely new NPC, which you can do by right
clicking the NPC list and clicking "new", but this is made difficult by the way in which the hair colours work, as
there is no exsisting colours for it. Due to this, the only way to change hair colour is to change the amount
of red, blue and green in the colour. Needless to say, this makes creating new hair colours somewhat difficult.
You can create a new NPC if you are up to the task, but either way the best place to start is changing the ID, (In "Edit Base") as
this means that the caracter will be your own, and you will not be changing the base of a pre-exsisting character
or leaving the ID blank. After changing the ID (The ID is the name of the NPC/Object etc. in the GECK, It does not show up in game), perhaps to the name of your character, or to a key
(e.g. "GhoulViolent01). You can move onto the "Name" which is the name shown whilst in game. (I would reccommend 
that you start your ID with a prefix, e.g. "000" or "ZZZ" to make it easy to find and be searched for. See 
systematic naming tutorial). Call your character whatever you like, and take note of the tick boxes underneath the
name and script (leave "Script" empty for now, not all characters require scripts).

These tick boxes and there
uses are detailed in the link at the top, but i will explain them nontheless. "Quest Item" means that NPCs update
more frequently, and that there body is not removed when the cell regenerates. "Is CharGen Face Preset" when 
ticked allows the character to choose that as a preset when creating there character. "No Low Level Processing"
means that the NPC does not update its AI unless the the player is in the same cell as it. "Essential" means that
the player does not die, and is instead only temporarily knocked unconsious. "No Knockdowns" means that the 
character is never knocked over by any attack. "No VATS Melee" means that the player cannot go into VATS with this
NPC if they are holding a melee weapon. "Respawn" means that any references of this NPC in the world die, they 
will be recreated after 3 days. "Finally, "Can Be All Races" allows the NPC's race to be changed later in the 
game. It is used by your Dad on Fallout 3. Check the appropriate boxes, (often none) and remove an actor base if 
you've got one as this will prevent you from modifying the NPC. Do this, and then move over to the traits tab when
you are done.
</p>
<p>
On the traits tab, and the tabs that follow such as the stats tab, some of the options should be fairly self explanatry, such as "Race", "Health" and the options for attributes and skills. (On the stats page)(Edit the skills by clicking on them and then hitting F2, just as you would to rename the ID for a level.) These can be changed according to who you want your character to be, and what he/she does. Some of the options are more confusing, and so we will go through these in detail. On the traits tab, what we need to go through are such things as the "Height" and "Voice type". The height starts on 0, but this is decieving. Really, the average height is 1.000, and will be if you edit it. When editing heights (Perhaps for a 6'5 phsycopath?), beware that making your character have a height 0f 2.000 makes him <B> double the size </b> of the previous character. Therefore, for most intensive purposes you want your character's height to be more like 1.360 or something similar, as this will make him 0.360 of his height taller, so about a third taller than the average person. To make him/her smaller, the same rules apply, but with e.g. 0.800 to make them only about 4 fifths of the height of other people. {Weight} Now to go on with other things on the traits tab, the "Voice type" is the voice that the character will speak in when not engaged in   advanced dialogue. (NO SYNTHISIS FOR ADVANCED DIALOGUE) This often involves unusually friendly "hellos to player!", angry battle talk, complaints about you swinging your weapon with them nearby etc. There are many different voice types, from "GroupRaiderMale" to "{}", each with their own voice options and accents. Needles to say, Raider voice types are not very friendly, and if made unagressive they are at a loss for words. Thats about it for the traits tab, and so we will move on.
