<h2> What are NPCs, and how do they work? </h2>

<p>
NPCs are simply the AI characters (Those that are not controlled by the player). They have many options that can
be changed in the <b>Base</b>, these can be identified in the 
<a href="http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php/Category:NPC">GECK Wiki.</a> This will tell you the definitions, but 
what you also need to know for sure is the basics. For instance, despite what may be said, we are sad to inform
you that for any advanced dialoge options voice acting is required. This will be detailed in the page on dialoge.
</p>
<p>
There are two main types of NPCs; levelling dummies, and unlevelled characters. Each work in different ways, but
unlevelled characters are the simplest and easiest to start off with, and so here is where we will start the
tutorial. As shown in the above link, there are a number of tabs, such as Traits, Stats, AI data, AI packages,
Factions etc. You will come to know and love/ hate all of them at one time or another.
