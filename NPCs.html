<h1> NPCs </h1>
<h2> What are NPCs, and how do they work? </h2>

<p>
NPCs are simply the AI characters (Those that are not controlled by the player) NPC stands for "Non Player Character. They have many options that can
be changed in the <b>Base</b>, these can be identified in the 
<a href="http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php/Category:NPC">GECK Wiki.</a> This will tell you the definitions, but 
what you also need to know for sure is the basics. For instance, despite what may be said, we are sad to inform
you that for any advanced dialoge options voice acting is required. This will be detailed in the page on dialoge.
</p>
<p>
There are two main types of NPCs; levelling dummies and unlevelled characters. Each work in different ways, but
unlevelled characters are the simplest and easiest to start off with, so here is where we will start the
tutorial. As shown in the above link, there are a number of tabs such as Traits, Stats, AI data, AI packages,
Factions etc. You will come to know and love/hate all of them at one time or another.
So now you know what NPCs are, and how they work, we can get down to business.
</p>
<h2> Time to make some NPCs </h2>
<p>
So now you should have a good size building interior; cluttered and lit. So why not add some baddies to fight?
To start on creating an NPC the best idea is probably to grab one that you like the look of from the NPC menu 
(under "Actors", "NPC") and edit him/her. You may wish to create an entirely new NPC, which you can do by right
clicking the NPC list and clicking "new", but this is made difficult by the way in which the hair colours work, as
there is no exsisting colours for it. Due to this, the only way to change hair colour is to change the amount
of red, blue and green in the colour. Needless to say, this makes creating new hair colours somewhat difficult.
You can create a new NPC if you are up to the task, but either way the best place to start is changing the ID, (In "Edit Base") as
this means that the caracter will be your own, and you will not be changing the base of a pre-exsisting character
or leaving the ID blank. After changing the ID (The ID is the name of the NPC/Object etc. in the GECK, It does not show up in game), perhaps to the name of your character, or to a key
(e.g. "GhoulViolent01). You can move onto the "Name" which is the name shown whilst in game. (I would reccommend 
that you start your ID with a prefix, e.g. "000" or "ZZZ" to make it easy to find and be searched for. See 
systematic naming tutorial). Call your character whatever you like, and take note of the tick boxes underneath the
name and script (leave "Script" empty for now, not all characters require scripts).
<img class="screenshot" src="Images/Stills/NCP Screenshot-cropped 1.png" id="NPC Screenshot 1">
These tick boxes and there
uses are detailed in the link at the top, but i will explain them nontheless. "Quest Item" means that NPCs update
more frequently, and that there body is not removed when the cell regenerates. "Is CharGen Face Preset" when 
ticked allows the character to choose that as a preset when creating there character. "No Low Level Processing"
means that the NPC does not update its AI unless the the player is in the same cell as it. "Essential" means that
the player does not die, and is instead only temporarily knocked unconsious. "No Knockdowns" means that the 
character is never knocked over by any attack. "No VATS Melee" means that the player cannot go into VATS with this
NPC if they are holding a melee weapon. "Respawn" means that any references of this NPC in the world die, they 
will be recreated after 3 days. "Finally, "Can Be All Races" allows the NPC's race to be changed later in the 
game. It is used by your Dad on Fallout 3. Check the appropriate boxes, (often none) and remove an actor base if 
you've got one as this will prevent you from modifying the NPC. Do this, and then move over to the traits tab when
you are done.
</p>
<p>
On the traits tab, and the tabs that follow such as the stats tab, some of the options should be fairly self explanatry, such as "Race", "Health" and the options for attributes and skills. (On the stats page)(Edit the skills by clicking on them and then hitting F2, just as you would to rename the ID for a level.) These can be changed according to who you want your character to be, and what he/she does. Some of the options are more confusing, and so we will go through these in detail. On the traits tab, what we need to go through are such things as the "Height" and "Voice type". The height starts on 0, but this is decieving. Really, the average height is 1.000, and will be if you edit it. When editing heights (Perhaps for a 6'5 phsycopath?), beware that making your character have a height 0f 2.000 makes him <b> double the size </b> of the previous character. Therefore, for most intensive purposes you want your character's height to be more like 1.360 or something similar, as this will make him 0.360 of his height taller, so about a third taller than the average person. To make him/her smaller, the same rules apply, but with e.g. 0.800 to make them only about 4 fifths of the height of other people. {Weight} Now to go on with other things on the traits tab, the "Voice type" is the voice that the character will speak in when not engaged in advanced dialogue. (NO SYNTHISIS FOR DIALOGUE) This often involves unusually friendly "hellos to player!", angry battle talk, complaints about you swinging your weapon with them nearby etc. There are many different voice types, from "GroupRaiderMale" to "Moira Brown", each with their own voice options and accents. Needles to say, Raider voice types are not very friendly, and if made unagressive they are at a loss for words. That's about it for the traits tab, and so we will move on.
</p>
<p>
On the stats tab, you will notice the Attributes, Skills and Health like I mentioned earlier, but there are also a few other options. You should be able to see an area saying "{Fatigue}" under the skills. Mostly, this is not very important, but ensure that your character's {Fatigue} is above 0, or he will fall over when punched. (But not when whacked with a melee weapon for some reason)[Anything else]
On the next tab, "AI Data", the character's "Agression" is in need of attention. It is important to note that most enemies will be "Very agressive", as "Frenzied" actually means that the NPC in question will attack literally anyone nearby, including those in the same faction as it. You will also notice that there is an option for who they help, choose from "Helps friends and allies", "Helps Allies" and "Helps Nobody". This will be dependent on the faction that they are in, and who counts as friends, allies or enemies to that faction. Also, the combat style is important, as it dictates the exact way that the NPC fights. You can only pick out of exsisting combat styles to begin with, but making your own is relatively simple. Go to "Miscallaneous", and "CombatStyle", and either pick one of the exsisting combat styles to change the ID of, and edit to what you want, or right click on the object window (with the combat styles section loaded) and then click "New", and start from there. For now, you can just change the combat style to "default". [Anything Else]
</p>
<p>
The next tab is the factions tab. You can view who counts as enemies to certain factions, and who counts as allies and friends. There is a good article on factions in the <a href= "http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?
title=Category:Factions">GECK Wiki.</a> Also look at the "factions tab" once you have opened the GECK Wiki link.
You will probably want either to make your own faction, or, if you are not up to that, just make enemies share an exsisting faction. (E.g. Raider faction)
</p>
<p>
The next tab is AI packages, wich dictates how the player will act, if they will eat or drink etc. and when. It also dictates where they will go, and more advanced things such as quest related actions. This tutorial section is under construction, find more info on the <a href= "http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php?title=Category:Packages#Location_Window:">GECK Wiki.</a>
</p>
<p>
We move on to the inventory tab, possibly one of the most important NPC tabs. You will notice that if you are making your character from a pre-exsisting one, the inventory box has got all of his/her stuff in it. Delete that, so that you have a clear box as you would if your character was new. With no inventory, your NPC has no clothes, no weapons, and in fact nothing at all. This needs to be changed, so right click on the empty box and click "New". Instantly, a light will show up in the NPCs inventory. "AAAlighttest01" or something. The only reason why this is here is because it is at the top of the object list. Clearly, we don't want a light in our NPCs inventory, as this doesn't work in game. So go to the list of items under the inventory window, and change it to what we want. We'll start with some clothes. I'm going to give mine "Outfitmerc04" (You can search the list by typing the ID of what you want. For instance, to search for clothes, type "Outfit" and for armours type "Armor"). You may want to know what these clothes look like in game, so at the very bottom of the inventory tab window check the box {"Full"}. This will give you a full body preview of the NPC, complete with his/her clothes. So you should clearly be able to see your character now, but he/she still needs a weapon. Why  not give them a gun? Right click on the box and click "new" again. (If you right click on an exsisting object in their inventory, and then click new, it will duplicate that object, with the same ammount of it as there was last time. This can be very useful for searching for objects with similar names.) All weapons on fallout are identified with the prefix "Weap", to make them easier to find. Type "Weap", and then use the arrow keys to navigate the list (Or just type the full name). Find one that you like, (I'll give mine an assault rifle, or "WeapAssaultRifle") and then select it. Now he needs some Ammo. All ammo on fallout is identified with the prefix "Ammo", so type this in and find the appropriate ammunition for your weapon, e.g. I will need "Ammo5.56mm". Go to where it says "Count" under the inventory box. At the moment he only has one bullet, which seems a little unlikely. To change this, click on the box, and replace that "1" with something more believable, for me about 68 should be suitable. That should do, but you can also add some other things if you like, perhaps some caps? (Caps001) or some whiskey? {(Whiskey)}
