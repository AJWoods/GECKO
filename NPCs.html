<h2> What are NPCs, and how do they work? </h2>

<p>
NPCs are simply the AI characters (Those that are not controlled by the player). They have many options that can
be changed in the <b>Base</b>, these can be identified in the 
<a href="http://geck.bethsoft.com/index.php/Category:NPC">GECK Wiki.</a> This will tell you the definitions, but 
what you also need to know for sure is the basics. For instance, despite what may be said, we are sad to inform
you that for any advanced dialoge options voice acting is required. This will be detailed in the page on dialoge.
</p>
<p>
There are two main types of NPCs; levelling dummies, and unlevelled characters. Each work in different ways, but
unlevelled characters are the simplest and easiest to start off with, and so here is where we will start the
tutorial. As shown in the above link, there are a number of tabs, such as Traits, Stats, AI data, AI packages,
Factions etc. You will come to know and love/hate all of them at one time or another.
So now you know what NPCs are, and how they work, we can get down to business.

So now you should have a good size building interior; cluttered and lit. So why not add some baddies to fight?
To start on creating an NPC the best idea is probably to grab one that you like the look of from the NPC menu 
(under "Actors", "NPC") and edit him/her. You may wish to create an entirely new NPC, which you can do by right
clicking the NPC list and clicking "new", but this is made difficult by the way in which the hair colours work, as
there is no exsisting colours for hair. Due to this, the only way to change hair colour is to change the ammount
of red, blue and green in the colour. Needless to say, this makes creating new hair colours somewhat difficult.
You can create a new NPC if you are up to the task, but either way the best place to start is changing the ID, as
this means that the caracter will be your own, and you will not be changing the base of a pre-exsisting character
or leaving the name blank. After changing the ID, perhaps to the name of your character, or to a key
(e.g. "GhoulViolent01), you can move onto the "Name" which is the name shown whilst in game. (I would reccommend 
that you start your ID with a prefix, e.g. "000" or "ZZZ" to make it easy to find and be searched for).
