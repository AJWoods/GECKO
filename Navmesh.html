<h2> What is navmesh, and How to place and edit it.
<p>
Navmesh is a area made up of linked triangles that dictates where the NPCs can move. Without navmesh, any NPCs will be seen to act somewhat erratically; running in the opposite direction to you, standing in the corner of a room etc. Therefore navmesh is absolutley imperative to any levels with enemies inside, and so you will definitley need some for your tutorial plugin.
</p>
<h2> Down to business </h2>
<p>
There are two ways to start with navmesh.The first option is to navigate to the top of the screen, and then go to the drop down menu labelled "Navmesh". Select {"Generate navmesh"} and then wait for a bit whilst it loads. You can also use {something} to only auto navmesh the area you have selected, which can be useful given the incomplete nature of areas of navmesh in certain tiles, such as caves.
