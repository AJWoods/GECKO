<h2> FX- What it does, and how to place it. </h2>

<p>
If you have seen the many coloured and oddly-shaped areas under "Moveable static", "Effects" you are probably deading this. However, FX is mostly relatively simple. For many effects, simply drag the the FX you want, for today {}. Place it on the floor of your current plugin, (Hotkey F instantly moves objects to what is underneath them) and then press the Havok physics enable button on the menu bar to see what it the FX looks like.

In this case, you should see dust regularly blowing across the floor of your level. This is what it will look like in game, and yes, it is that simple.
This is the same for many of the FX items, such as vultures, mist, dust clouds etc.
